# Casear-Cipher-Cybersecurity-Algorithm
This is my Casear Cipher Python Cybersecurity project


This uses python in taking input text from the user and then encrypts the text through a cipher algorithm. It therefore deciphers the given text. 

This output shows the original plaintext, the encrypted ciphertext, and the decrypted text which should match the original plaintext.

--Instructions--
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running: python --version
2. Navigate to the given script directory: It will look similar to this: cd path/to/your/script
3. Run the python script with the command: python caesar_cipher.py
