# Casear-Cipher-Cybersecurity-Algorithm
Hey Everyone and welcome back to my GitHub!

This is my Casear Cipher Python Cybersecurity project which I created using the Python programming language.

The overall function is to take input text from the user and encrypt it using a cipher algorithm. It then deciphers the given text and displays it to the user. 

This output shows the original plaintext, the encrypted ciphertext, and the decrypted text which should match the original plaintext.

This helped me focus on cybersecurity security concepts like encryption and object-oriented programming functionality with Python.

--Instructions--
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running: python --version
2. Navigate to the given script directory: It will look similar to this: cd path/to/your/script
3. Run the Python script with the command: python caesar_cipher.py
